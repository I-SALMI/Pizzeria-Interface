## :dart: About ##

The following is a react web app that is ready to be configured to run the consume the Pizzeria API

## :rocket: Technologies ##

The following tools were used in this project:

- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)

## :white_check_mark: Requirements ##

Before starting , you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## :dart: Improvements ##

- The current interface is not connected to the API, I couldn't complete that part due to insufficient time. It is however ready to be configured for the basic CRUD operations for a pizza.
- Another improvement would be to add to the interface the elements to execute CRUD operations on the ingredients as well
- We can also personalize the interface to show more detailed informations about each pizza and to enable us to add ingredients while creating a pizza
